* [Download Project (.jar | 233 KB)](bellmcp.github.io/work/KnightsTour_2.jar)
* [Download Java Runtime Environment (Direct Link)](https://www.java.com/en/download/)

# What I Learned

* Developed a user interface within the Windows Forms App (.NET Framework) using ToolStrip, TextBox, Label & Button.
* Implemented functinality to the UI: `buttonClick`, `disableButtons`, `newGame`, & `resetCount`.
* Integrated Warnsdorff's rule algorithm to the program. [(Wikipedia)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knight%27s_tour)

# Future Ideas Include

* Add an ability to customize a different sizes chessboards.
* Implement other algorithms such as Brute-force algorithm, Common backtracking algorithm, Divide and conquer algorithms etc.
* Improve performance and reliability.
