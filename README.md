# Resources

* [Download Project (.jar | 233 KB)](bellmcp.github.io/work/KnightsTour_2.jar)
* [Download Java Runtime Environment (Direct Link)](https://www.java.com/en/download/)

# What I Learned

* Developed a user interface within the Windows Forms App (.NET Framework) using ToolStrip, TextBox, Label & Button.
* Implemented functinality to the UI: `buttonClick`, `disableButtons`, `newGame`, & `resetCount`.
* Integrated Tic Tac Toe logic strategy to the `winnerCheck` function. (based on [Wikipedia's strategy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe#Strategy))

# Future Ideas Include

* Add an ability to have the X and O on the board be different colors.
* Implement an unbeatable AI in single player mode.
* Welcome screen to let player switch between single player and multiplayer mode.
